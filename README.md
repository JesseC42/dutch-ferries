# dutch-ferries

This repository contains an open GTFS-feed of the smaller Ferries in the Netherlands. It is still a work-in-progress. The frequencies related to the trips are auto-generated and the stops and the shapes still require manual checking.

If you would like to try out the current state, download the zip of the master branch: https://github.com/plannerstack/map-data-issues/archive/master.zip and run it in your favorite GTFS application.
